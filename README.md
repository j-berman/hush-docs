## How does it work?

Docs are stored in the browser using IndexedDB ([Dexie.js](https://dexie.org/)), so you can create and edit docs whenever you want, no internet or account needed. If you decide you want to sync across devices, or collaborate with others on a doc, you can create an account at any time. Docs are then end-to-end encrypted using [Userbase](https://userbase.com/), and remain in sync using CRDTs ([Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge)). No server ever has access to the docs!
